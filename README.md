# [D.I.S.H. - Dynamic Internationalization Scanner and Harvester](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fizzog/dish?activeTab=readme)

A developer tool for managing localization files. Includes support for scanning and analyzing project usage, detecting orphaned keys, and providing a streamlined process for handling localization files in your project.

Specifically, this project is designed to work with `react-i18next` by tracking usage of `useTranslation` and `t('key')`.
